My name is Mopsy and I am available for adoption.<p/><p/>I was brought in by my previous owner on May 18, 2021 because they could no longer care for me. I lived in a home with other rabbits.<p/><p/>Rabbits are intelligent and complex animals who do well in families with humans who understand that they are prey animals, and do not enjoy being picked up or held. The best way to bond with me is to spend time with me on the floor, and shower me with plenty of greens and timothy hay! <p/><p/>I am a domestic rabbit and it is recommend that adopters keep me indoors. The nice thing about having an indoor rabbit is that I can come out of my cage for bunny playtime, in a rabbit proof area of the home. It's during this supervised playtime that rabbits often exhibit some of our most fun and interesting behaviors!<p/><p/>I would love a family who will interact with me daily to keep me active and social! When rabbits get the space and enrichment they need, we often form deep bonds with our humans!<p/><p/>My personality color is BLUE. I am a gentle and loving rabbit who likes to take things slow. I may get nervous in new situations, so I am looking for a family who understands that I might need some time to warm up. Once I get to know you, I will be a very devoted friend!<p/><p/>If you would like to make an appointment to meet me, please call the front desk at 206-263-1320.<p/>",BLUE

The best way to bond with me is to spend time with me on the floor, and shower me with plenty of greens and timothy hay! <p/><p/>I am a domestic rabbit and it is recommend that adopters keep me indoors. The nice thing about having an indoor rabbit is that I can come out of my cage for bunny playtime, in a rabbit proof area of the home. It's during this supervised playtime that rabbits often exhibit some of our most fun and interesting behaviors!<p/><p/>I would love a family who will interact with me daily to keep me active and social! When rabbits get the space and enrichment we need, we often form deep bonds with our humans!<p/><p/>",BLUE

Infection is lifelong and there is no cure.  Cats infected with feline leukemia virus typically live shorter lifespans, although with proper care and management, some cats can have a good quality of life.  Please refer to the information handout.<p/><p/>2)  This animal has been diagnosed with kidney disease.  This condition can be managed with special diets and medications.  Treatment will be lifelong.  Please follow up with your regular veterinarian for the best treatment plan.  We have also included a handout with more information on this disease.<p/><p/>",GREEN

My name is Maya and I am available for adoption. I am a big girl, weighing in at about 103 pounds!<p/><p/>I am currently the shelter's longest dog resident, and I hope that I can finally find my home for the holidays.<p/><p/>I was brought in by my previous owner on November 12, 2020 because they had medical issues and could no longer care for me. My previous owner described me as super friendly and very loving, as well as very strong and active!  I have been affectionate and sweet with my caretakers at the shelter, and they can't wait to help me meet my perfect forever family.<p/><p/>I am a Dogue de Bordeaux, the most ancient of French dog breeds. Legend has it that my breed was introduced to France by Julius Caesar! Like my breed standard, I am a sweet, loyal and sensitive soul.<p/><p/>I was nominated as the Pet of the Week on December 8, 2020--this means that my adoption fee has been waived!  However, please note that a pet license is a requirement and therefore a fee may be applied. This helps my safe return home should I become lost, and comes with additional benefits such as Vacation Pet Alert, Free Ride Home and more (visit our pet licensing page for more info)!<p/><p/>Staff here noticed that I am a bit of a princess--I much prefer the company of grownup humans to other cats and dogs. I would do best as the only pet in an adult only home.<p/><p/>My personality color is RED. I am a spirited dog with a fun-loving personality! I am still working on my manners, so I would do best with a family who is willing to work with me and help me become the best dog I can be!<p/><p/><p/>",RED

Though I may be timid at first, once you take the time to show me I can trust you I will show you just how wonderful I can be.<p/><p/>Current medical conditions are noted below.<p/><p/>1)    Feline Leukemia Virus<p/><p/>This cat tested positive for Feline Leukemia Virus (FeLV).  Cats infected with this virus may have an active, or latent infection.  Active infection leads to immunosuppression, increased susceptibility to disease, or lymphosarcoma.  Infected cats are expected to have a decreased lifespan and will require additional veterinary care.  However, with care, these cat may have a good quality of life for months to years.  FeLV is transmitted to other cats through saliva and activities such as sharing water bowls, communal grooming and social contact.  For this reason, this cat should be kept as a single cat or with other FeLV positive cats.  Please consult with your regular veterinarian for additional information and a management plan for your new pet.<p/>",BLUE

This means there is an abnormal heart sound when we listen to the heart.  In some animals, this can indicate heart disease.  However, other animals can have heart murmurs and never show any symptoms of heart disease.  We recommend that you follow up with your regular veterinarian.  Please see the handout for more information about this condition.<p/><p/>2)  This animal has been diagnosed as hyperthyroid.  This means that thyroid gland is producing an excess of hormones.  This disease can be easily managed with daily medication, radioactive iodine treatment or prescription diet.  Please follow up with you regular veterinarian to create a treatment plan.

My name is Gracie and I am available for adoption. I was nominated as the Pet of the Week on October 12, 2021. This means that my adoption fee has been reduced. Please note that a pet license is a requirement and therefore a fee may be applied. This helps my safe return home should I become lost, and comes with additional benefits such as Vacation Pet Alert, Free Ride Home and more (visit our pet licensing page for more info)!<p/><p/>I was brought in by my previous owner on 8/21 because the landlord doesnt allow dogs.<p/><p/>My personality color is RED. I am a spirited dog with a fun-loving personality! I am still working on my manners, so I would do best with a family who is willing to work with me and help me become the best dog I can be!<p/><p/>I am a very smart dog! At the shelter I am practicing how to ""sit"", ""stay"", ""come"", ""down"" and ""shake"".<p/><p/>I am an affectionate lovebug who would be thrilled to cuddle up with you at home!<p/><p/>I am full of energy and I love to play! I tend to calm down more when the people around me stay calm. I do best when I have lots of exercise and something to keep my mind busy.<p/><p/>My caregivers have observed that I might not get along with other dogs. I may do best as the only dog in my new home, or I may need a very slow introduction to other dogs.<p/><p/>I have been known to resource guard, meaning that I am displaying behavior that is intended to convince other dogs or humans to stay away from a particular treasure or ""resource."" The resource that I tend to guard is food and treats. If you take me home you will benefit from in home guidance to help to manage and improve this behavior.<p/><p/><p/>",RED

My name is Ariya and I am available for adoption. I was brought in by my previous owner on 06/04/2021 because my owner had no time for me. I lived in a home with other cat but the two of us DID NOT get along. My previous owner described me as very affectionate.<p/><p/>I may get nervous in new situations, so I am looking for a family who understands that I might need some time to warm up. Once I get to know you, I will be a very devoted friend!<p/><p/>I am an affectionate lovebug who would be thrilled to cuddle up with you at home! I love to talk with my caretakers, and solicit a lot of attention.<p/><p/>I like getting attention on my own terms. I can get overstimulated with petting, so please move carefully with me and keep an eye out for signs that I might need a break.<p/><p/>I was nominated as the Pet of the Week on 08/24/21. This means that my adoption fee has been reduced. Please note that a pet license is a requirement and therefore a fee may be applied. This helps my safe return home should I become lost, and comes with additional benefits such as Vacation Pet Alert, Free Ride Home and more (visit our pet licensing page for more info)!<p/><p/>My personality color is RED. I am a spirited cat with a fun-loving personality! I may be sensitive to handling, so I would do best in a home with a cat savvy family who knows when to give me some space.<p/><p/>Current medical conditions are noted below.<p/><p/>1) Feline leukemia virus is transmitted to other cats through saliva and activities such as sharing water bowls, communal grooming and social contact.  Infection is lifelong and there is no cure.  Cats infected with feline leukemia virus typically live shorter lifespans, although with proper care and management, some cats can have a good quality of life.  Please refer to the information handout.<p/><p/><p/><p/><p/>",RED
